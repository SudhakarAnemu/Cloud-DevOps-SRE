# Cloud computing

## What Is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud Computing**

The delivery of a shared pool of on-demand computing services over the public internet, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

**The 5 Characteristics of Cloud**

1. On-demand Self Service - Provision resources automatically without requiring human interaction
2. Broad Network Access - Available over the network
3. Resource Pooling - Pooled resources to support a multi-tenant model allowing multiple customers to share the same applications or the same physical infrastructure
4. Rapid Elasticity - Rapidly provision and de-provision any of the cloud computing resources
5. Measured Service - Resource usage can be monitored, controlled and reported using metering capabilities

**Benefits of Cloud**

Agility - Flexibility for provisioning resources, Innovate faster

Cost - Pay as you go, Trade capital expenditure for variable expense

Speed - Resources on demand, Scriptable infrastructure

Global - Global data centres, Disaster recovery becomes easier, High availability

Security - Always up-to-date, Physical security, Encryption at rest and in transit, Compliance

## Characteristics

a. Ondemand self service - automatic creation(minimal efforts)

b. Broad NW access - avaialble on NW

c. Resource pooling  -  Multiple customers can / should share resources with a secuirty.

Ex : ppl living in an apartment but security will be there for their home

d. Rapic elasticity

e. Measured service  (monitoirng and alerting)

## Cloud deployment models

public (1 public cloud), private (on-prem cloud)), multi-cloud (2 or more public cloud),

hybrid cloud - (private cloud+public clud)

Hybrid cloud and Hybrid environments are both different.

## Cloud Service Models (XaaS)

IaaS: IaaS businesses offer services such as pay-as-you-go storage,
networking, and virtualization. IaaS gives users cloud-based
alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, so businesses can avoid
investing in expensive on-site resources.

PaaS: A PaaS vendor provides hardware and software tools over the
internet, and people use these tools to develop applications. PaaS users
 tend to be developers.

SaaS: SaaS platforms make software available to users over the internet, usually for a monthly subscription fee.

On-premise: software that’s installed in the same building as your business.

# Cloud SDK and CLI

![1731100065274](image/CloudComputing/1731100065274.png)

**Cloud SDK**

Set of command line tools that allow you to manage resources through the terminal

* gcloud
* gsutil
* bq
* Kubectl

A user account is a Google account that allows end-users to authenticate directly to your application. For most common use cases on a single machine, using a user account is best practice.

A service account is a Google account associated with your GCP project and not a specific user. A service account can be used by providing a service account key to your application and is recommended to script Cloud SDK tools for use on multiple machines.

**Gcloud Init** - Authorizes access and performs other common Cloud SDK setup steps.

**gcloud auth login** - Authorize access for gcloud with Google user credentials

**Gcloud config** - Allows you to configure accounts and projects

**gcloud components** - Allow you to install, update and delete the components of the sdk

# IAM - Identity and access mgmt

## Cloud IAM

![1731192149148](image/CloudComputing/1731192149148.png)

![1731190735919](image/CloudComputing/1731190735919.png)

![1731190832999](image/CloudComputing/1731190832999.png)

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)**

You manage access control by defining who (identity) has what access (role) for which resource. This also includes organizations, folders, and projects.

A **policy** is a collection of bindings, audit configuration, and metadata.

A **binding** specifies how access should be granted on resources. It binds one or more members with a single role and any context-specific conditions that change how and when the role is granted.

The **metadata** includes additional information about the policy, such as an etag and version to facilitate policy management.

The **AuditConfig** field specifies the configuration data for how access attempts should be audited.

**Google Account** - Any email address that's associated with a Google Account, including gmail.com or other domains.

**Service Account** - An account for an application instead of an individual end user.

**Google Groups** - A named collection of Google Accounts and service accounts

**G Suite Domain** - Google Accounts that have been created in an organization's G Suite account

**Cloud Identity Domain** - Google Accounts in an organization that are not tied to any G Suite applications or features

**AllAuthenticatedUsers** - A special identifier that represents all service accounts and all users on the internet who have authenticated with a Google Account

**AllUsers** - A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet, including authenticated and unauthenticated users

**Roles**

* This is a named collection of permissions that grant access to perform actions on Google Cloud resources.
* You cannot grant a permission to the user directly
* You grant a role to a user and all the permissions that the role contains.

**Permissions**

* Determines what operations are allowed on a resource
* Correspond one-to-one with REST API methods
* Not granted to users directly
* E.g., compute.instances.list

**Primitive** - Roles historically available in the Google Cloud

* Owner
* Editor
* Viewer
* Avoid using these roles if possible

**Predefined** - Finer-grained access control than the primitive roles

**Custom** - Tailor permissions to the needs of your organization

**Conditions**

* Used to define and enforce conditional, attribute-based access control for Google Cloud resources.
* Conditions allow you to choose granting resource access to identities only if configured conditions are met
* When a condition exists, the access request is only granted if the condition expression = true

**Metadata**

* To help prevent a race condition when updating the policy, IAM supports concurrency control through the use of an etag field in the policy

**Audit Config**

* Determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging

## Policies and Conditions

![1731192425002](image/CloudComputing/1731192425002.png)

**Policy Limitations**

* 1 policy per resource (including organizations, folders, projects)
* 1500 members or 250 Google groups per policy
* Up to 7 minutes for policy changes to fully propagate across GCP
* Limit of 100 conditional role bindings per policy

Conditions - Condition attributes are either based on resource or based on details about the request (timestamp, originating/destination IP address)

**Condition Limitations**

* Limited to specific services
* Primitive roles are unsupported
* Members cannot be allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers
* Limit of 100 conditional role bindings per policy
* 20 role bindings for same role and same member

**AuditConfig Logs**

Specifies the audit configuration for a service. The configuration determines which permission types are logged, and what identities, if any, are exempted from logging. An AuditConfig must have one or more AuditLogConfigs.

## Service Accounts

![1731328071126](image/GCPCloudComputing/1731328071126.png)

A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or a virtual machine (VM) instance, not a person.

An application uses the service account to authenticate between the application and GCP services so that the users aren't directly involved

A special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.

**Service Account types**

* User-managed, User created, You choose the name
  service-account-name@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com

**Default**

* ~Using some GCP services create user-managed service accounts~
* ~Automatically granted the Editor role for the project~
* When using certain GCP services, default service accounts are automatically created. These are user-managed service accounts.
* These default service accounts are automatically granted the **Editor** role for the project
  project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
  project-number-compute@developer.gservcieaccount.com

**Google-managed**

* Managed by Google, and they are used by Google services
* Some are visible, some hidden
* Name ends with "Service Agent" or "Service Account”

**Service Account Keys**

**Key Management** – None, All handled by Google

**User managed**

**Key Management** - Key storage, Key distribution, Key revocation, Key rotation, Protecting the keys from unauthorized users, Key recovery

**Access scopes**

* Service Account scopes are the legacy method of specifying permissions for your instance
* And they are used in substitution of IAM roles
* These are used specifically for default
* Or automatically created service accounts
* Based on enabled API's

## Cloud Identity

![1731343652938](image/GCPCloudComputing/1731343652938.png)

**loud Identity** is an Identity as a Service (IDaaS) solution that centrally manages users and groups. This would be the sole system for authentication and that provides a single sign-on experience for all employees of an organization to be used for all your internal and external applications.

**Device management** - lets people in any organization access their work accounts from mobile devices while keeping the organization's data more secure.

**Security** - Helps by applying security best practices along with being able to deploy 2SV for the whole company along with enforcement controls and can also manage passwords to make sure they are meeting the enforced password requirements automatically.

**Single Sign-on** - With single sign-on (SSO), users can access many applications without having to enter their username and password for each application

**Reporting** - This covers audit logs for logins, groups, devices and even tokens. You are even able to export these logs to BigQuery for analysis. You can then create reports from these logs that cover security, applications and activity.

**Directory Management** - Provides profile information for users in your organization, email and group addresses, and shared external contacts in the Directory. Using Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS), you can synchronize the data in your Google Account with your Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP server. GCDS doesn't migrate any content (such as email messages, calendar events, or files) to your Google Account. You use GCDS to synchronize all your users, groups, and shared contacts to match the information in your LDAP server.

**Google Cloud Directory Sync** is a free Google-provided tool that implements the synchronization process and can be run either on Google Cloud or in your on-premises environment. Synchronization is one-way so that Active Directory remains the source of truth.

![1731346923206](image/GCPCloudComputing/1731346923206.png)

**Policy Management**

* To grant access to all projects in your Organization, use an organization-level policy
* Grant roles to a Google group instead of individual users where possible
* When granting multiple roles to a particular task, create a Google group instead
