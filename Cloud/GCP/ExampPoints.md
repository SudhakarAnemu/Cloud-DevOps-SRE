2.Cloud Dataproc is a managed Spark/Hadoop service that can be used to migrate Hadoop clusters GCP. Cloud Pub/Sub is a queuing service that is used to ingest data and store it until it can be processed. Bigtable is a NoSQL database, not a queueing service. Cloud Dataflow is a stream and batch processing service, not a queueing service. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/how-to.

3.Cloud Data Fusion is a managed service that is designed for building data transformation pipelines. Compute Engine is not a managed service. Cloud Dataprep is used to prepare data for analytics and machine learning. Cloud Build is a service for creating container images. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/how-to.

4. The correct command is gsutil iam ch allUsers:objectViewer gs://free-photos-on-gcp. Gsutil is used with Cloud Storage, not gcloud so the gcloud ch option is incorrect. The term objectViewer is the correct way to grant read access to objects in a bucket. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/iam.
5. The correct command is gcloud datastore export gs://my-datastore-backup --async. Export, not backup, is the datastore command to save data to a Cloud Storage bucket. Gsutil is used to manage Cloud Storage, not Cloud Datastore. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/export-import-entities.
6. Regional clusters have replicas of the control plane while single zone and multi-zonal clusters have only one control plane. There is no such thing as multi-regional cluster. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/best-practices-for-creating-a-highly-available-gke-cluster.
7. Cloud Identity provides domain verification records, which are added to DNS settings for the domain. IAM is used to control access granted to identities, it is not a place to manage domains. The billing account is used for payment tracking, it is not a place to manage domains. Resources do have metadata, but that metadata is not used to manage domains. For more information on verifying domains, see https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/verify-domain.
8. The correct command is gcloud container images list. The other options are not valid gcloud commands. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/images/list.
9. Gcloud init will authorize access and perform other common setup steps. Gcloud auth login will authorize access only. Gcloud login and gcloud config login are not valid commands. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/initializing.
